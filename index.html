            <h3>What to Know</h3>
            <p>Dress to impress! We'll have a photographer and videographer capturing every special moment. The day will be outside, so please prepare for mountain weather and, for our evening around the fire, bring a few layers. Our amazing guests will need to arrange their own transport between locations, as none can be provided en masse.</p>
<div class="reduced-line-height">&nbsp;<br></div>

            </p><h3>Food & Drink</h3>
            <p>Delicious vegan options will be available both at the Lakeshore and at the Ponds; please let us know if you have any allergies that we'll need to be aware of. If you'd like to bring your own food items for the grill, you're more than welcome! We also ask that you please bring your own alcoholic drinks.<br></p>
